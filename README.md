This theme can be found on the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=xavianaxw.freya)

## Pre-requisites

The theme was built to support [Spaceship Prompt](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt) and uses Fira Code Mono patched by Nerd Fonts which you can download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6m73o7isybvz9tg/AACPWO3RNcDsBIkorFsu34nja?dl=1)

Here's also my [setup guide](https://gist.github.com/xavianaxw/8e75ff37adc45bc9d3d62ada2e72ff3f) that aligns visually with this theme for Hyper Terminal + zsh.

## Colors

Colors are based off the X11 color names because I wanted it to match my terminal colors with `colorls`. Here's the list of colors that I've used.

- darkcyan `#008b8b`
- lightseagreen  `#20B2AA`
- goldenrod `#DAA520`
- slategray `#708090`
- silver `#c0c0c0`

Non X11 colors
- `#ef6462`
